## R Markdown :)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo =FALSE}

table4.1 <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\nmckeon\\Documents\\ghg\\Table 4-1 for PY2020_nrm.xlsx")

dt <- table4.1

ft <- flextable(dt, col_keys = c("Sector",  "y1990","y2005", "y2018", "y2017", "y2016","y2015", "y2014") )
ft <- colformat_num(x = ft, big.mark = ",", digits = 1, na_str = "missing")
ft<- autofit(ft)
ft <- footnote( ft, i = 1, j = 1:3,
            value = as_paragraph(
              c("+ Indicates values less than 0.5 kt.")
            ),
            ref_symbols = c("a"),
            part = "header")
ft

```
